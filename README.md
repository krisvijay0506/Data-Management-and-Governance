# 🧩 Data Mesh Architecture Overview

**Data Mesh** is a modern decentralized data architecture approach that treats data as a product, with domain teams owning and managing their own data, while a centralized platform ensures governance, interoperability, and security.

## 🌐 Key Principles of Data Mesh

- **Decentralized Data Ownership**  
  Each domain team owns and manages its data as a product. This decentralization allows teams to build, maintain, and scale their data pipelines independently.

- **Centralized Governance Layer**  
  While ownership is decentralized, governance (such as security, lineage, and compliance) is enforced centrally through standardized policies and tooling—ensuring consistency and trust.

- **Domain-Oriented Architecture**  
  Data is organized around business domains (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Finance), aligning ownership with subject-matter expertise and promoting accountability.

- **Self-Serve Infrastructure as a Platform**  
  A central platform team provides reusable, self-serve tools (e.g., ingestion templates, CI/CD pipelines, data quality checks) so domain teams can build and manage data products efficiently.

- **Data as a Product**  
  Each dataset is treated like a product with well-defined SLAs, quality metrics, and discoverability—enhancing usability and trust across the organization.

- **Interoperability and Standardization**  
  Common standards for schemas, APIs, and data contracts enable domains to share and consume data easily without tight coupling.

## ✅ Advantages

- Scalable across large enterprises
- Promotes data democratization and agility
- Reduces bottlenecks from centralized data teams
- Improves data discoverability and productization

## 🧱 Dataplex Components

### 🔹 Lake
A **Lake** in Dataplex is the highest-level organizational construct. It typically represents a broad data domain or business unit within your organization (e.g., `marketing-lake`, `finance-lake`, `customer-analytics-lake`).

- Used to **group data logically** across zones and assets.
- Helps you **organize and isolate data** for different departments or domains.
- Enables **domain-specific access controls** and governance policies.

> 💡 Example: You can create a separate lake for each department—like Marketing, Sales, or Finance—to ensure that each team manages and accesses its own data independently, while still adhering to centralized governance policies.
